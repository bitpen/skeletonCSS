      <h1>bpen: skeleton CSS</h1>
      <p>
        I've always found most CSS frameworks to be either too big or too
        complicated to quickly start using.  Couple that with the mindset that basic
        CSS really isn't all that complicate and I generally end up needing the
        same basic layout/style structure, and I arrived at the CSS library
        presented here.
      </p>

        This skeleton CSS is not necessarily meant to be a fully fleshed out
        CSS library for a complex site.  However, it is a great jumping off
        point for quickly getting started with some basic, decent looking CSS
        when starting a new project.

        Some of the things to notice about this CSS framework:
        <ul>
          <li>It is lightweight in size and features</li>
          <li>It is minimalistic.  Clean simple styling and not much color,
          except for actionable items.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
